# **New Release: "Verses Under a Killing Moon" - A Collection of Macabre Poems for lost souls.** [Find it here!](https://a.co/d/8DQg3rT)

I am thrilled to announce the release of my new poetry book, "Verses Under a Killing Moon", a collection of poems that delve into the depths of the human experience. This book is a journey through the ups and downs of life, love, loss, and self-discovery, all woven together with words that aim to stir your soul.

## **About the Book**

"Verses Under a Killing Moon" is a collection of 16 poems that explore the intricacies of the human condition. From the joy and beauty of love and relationships, to the pain and struggle of loss and heartbreak, this book takes you on a emotional rollercoaster that will leave you breathless.

Each poem is a window into my own experiences, thoughts, and emotions, carefully crafted to evoke a sense of connection and understanding. I hope that through these words, you will find solace, inspiration, and a reminder that you are not alone in your own struggles.

Insight into my mindset while writing, it was one of those long nights where you are left tossing and turning, I just started writing about what I was feeling, confusion about the state of the world and sleep deprivity feeding into dark thoughts.

## **A Poem from the Book**

Here's a sneak peek at one of the poems from the book:

"The Silence Between Us"

Two hearts once beating as one,
Now lie still, like autumn leaves undone.
The silence between us grows,
A chasm deep, a void that shows.

The memories we made, now taunt,
Like ghosts that whisper "what's left to flaunt?"
We once laughed, we once loved,
But now our love is just a distant cloud.
