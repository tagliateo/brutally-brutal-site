## Ruby Install

Hey all this is going to be a quick blog post but I just want to highlight a blog post that I found that includes a step by step guide for installing ruby, ruby on rails, nodejs, mysql, postgres, and git all up and running on linux ubuntu/debian devices.

**Installing Ruby on Linux**

Being a Ruby developer, you can come across one major pain point, that is installing ruby. For some reason ruby is just very tricky to install, especially when you compare it to say installing java onto your machine.

This is a huge sticking point, and a lot of times the guides you find online are always outdated, which really does not help with anything.

Luckily, I was able to find a guide online that shows you exactly how to install ruby on your device. It was an incredibly easy to follow along and get everything up and running. I am incredibly thankful for this guide and hope this helps you out!
